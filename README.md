# Absolute-Humidity-Prediction

Introduction
------------
Predicting Absolute Humidity from Air Quality dataset from responses of a gas multisensor device deploy on field from an Italian city using artificial neural network (ANN) and Multiple regression model to determine the best predictive result.   
I am providing a documentation to show I built and created the python algorithms and tools to make the prediction from both Artificial Neural Network and Multiple regression models and arrive with the best predictive result. The workflow is shown below. 

Getting Data
------------

To begin, you will need access to a database of movies, all of which
